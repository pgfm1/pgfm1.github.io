                <p>
                <a href="https://builds.sr.ht">builds.sr.ht</a> is the 
                automated build system provided by 
                <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut</a>, which I use for
                most of my projects (git, lists, builds). It is based on simple
                YAML manifests which describe the required environment and 
                build steps. This build system is 
                <a href="https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/">documented</a>, and
                this article describes a specific configuration for Scala 
                projects. This configuration will be executed on push.

                <h3>Example build manifest</h3>
                <p>
                This file is called <span class="mono">.build.yml</span> and lives in the root 
                directory of your repository. This example uses the build
                definition from 
                the <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~eidolon/goose">goose</a> 
                project.
                </p>
<pre>
image: alpine/edge
packages:
  - openjdk11
  - sbt
sources:
  - https://git.sr.ht/~eidolon/goose
tasks:
  - prepare: |
      mkdir -p "$HOME/.sbt/1.0/plugins"
      echo 'addSbtPlugin("com.jsuereth" % "sbt-pgp" % "2.0.2")' &gt;&gt; "$HOME/.sbt/1.0/plugins/gpg.sbt"
  - test: |
      cd goose
      sbt test
</pre>
                <h4>&gt; image and packages</h4>
                <p>
                builds.sr.ht maintains a set of 
                <a href="https://man.sr.ht/builds.sr.ht/compatibility.md">supported build images</a>, 
                one of which is <span class="mono">alpine/edge</span>. This is
                sufficient for our builds - we need two dependencies:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>OpenJDK 11 (<span class="mono">openjdk11</span>)</li>
                    <li>SBT (<span class="mono">sbt</span>)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                The <span class="mono">packages</span> section of the manifest
                ensures that those will be installed prior to executing the 
                build scripts.
                </p>

                <h4>&gt; sources</h4>
                <p>
                This is where we pull the source of our project, which is 
                required to execute a build. The https URL is read-only.
                </p>

                <h4>&gt; tasks</h4>
                <p>
                The <span class="mono">tasks</span> section defines an ordered
                list of scripts to be evaluated. Since goose uses the
                <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-pgp">sbt-pgp</a> plugin and 
                relies on global setup, I add a 
                <span class="mono">prepare</span> task to ensure that is 
                available.
                </p>
                <p>
                At this point we can directly invoke 
                <span class="mono">sbt</span> and the build will "just work".
                If all tasks complete without failing, the build is marked
                successful!
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Signed Publication</h3>
                <p>
                In the above example, goose isn't actually publishing any
                artifacts to the central repository. Normally we would need to
                sign those artifacts with a PGP key. This is supported by the
                <a href="https://builds.sr.ht/secrets">sr.ht secrets</a> tool, 
                which manages secrets and allows you to inject them into your 
                builds.
                </p>
                <p>
                Once goose starts publishing, this article will be updated with
                the modifications to the build script. Another article will 
                also be drafted on publishing Scala projects in general.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Build Badges</h3>
                <p>
                Just visit the builds page for your project. The example for
                goose is 
                <span class="mono">https://builds.sr.ht/~eidolon/goose</span>.
                The badge markdown (corresponding to the listed builds) is 
                supplied on this page.
