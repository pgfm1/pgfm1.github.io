                <h3>Game List</h3>
                <p>
                As I play through a planned list of games, I'll add them here
                with a short review and impressions. Expect some good/bad 
                according to my preferences. I will not add games until I 
                finish them.

                <h3>Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete</h3>
                <span class="descriptor">psx</span>
                <p>
                Lunar is a simple story executed well. I think that's one of 
                its biggest strengths - it keeps a good pace and is very focused
                on the main quest. There are precious few side-stories in Lunar,
                and honestly that works. Additionally the world changes around
                you (per interactions with NPCs) as the story progresses, which
                is a fantastic touch. The attention to detail in those 
                interactions is superb. Paired with a very (relatively) short
                game, I really am happy with the execution of Lunar's story and
                world. If I were to play Lunar again, it would be to talk to
                more people at different transition points in the game, and 
                possibly to collect items that I missed (low priority). This 
                game also has voice acting and animated cutscenes which are fun
                given the era of the game. Finally, the game also keeps some
                (obvious, foreshadowed) secrets - this is done well and in a 
                fun way. Nothing is particularly crazy, but the story 
                <em>does</em> develop and it feels good.

                Early on the combat can be challenging and interesting. Leveling
                up occurs frequently and has meaning. My primary complaint with
                this game is the combat system and its impact on the late-game:
                Lunar becomes boring. By the end of the game I just wanted to be
                done, and most of that is on the combat system, battle progression. 
                and bosses. I was able to figure out combat early on, and it
                makes the combat extremely repetitive. The same set of attacks
                are optimal for clearing an area, and you can easily level and 
                progress without any item expenditure after a certain point. At
                the same time, there is nothing "extra" you can level or progress,
                you don't get more abilities or strategies that make a large 
                impact, and battles just... take time. This actually is 
                <em>not</em> incredibly detrimental until the second disk, but
                it does kick in quite heavily in the final few areas. This is
                especially unfortunate because learning the combat system was
                fun, and early encounters required attention.
                </p>

                <p>Now to discuss boss fights. Boss fights have very little
                variation in terms of strategy, and in some cases are pure RNG.
                One fight left a team member out of commission for 10+ rounds
                while I was AOE-spammed -- I just let my party die and tried 
                again. The subsequent fight was trivial and one member was out
                for 2 rounds total. I feel like the bosses in general are very
                poorly-designed compared to the rest of the game. There aren't
                even any mechanics to break up the monotony. Vigor and sword
                dance are the bread and butter that will carry every boss,
                including and especially at the end.
                </p>

                <p>
                Overall I'm happy that I played Lunar, but have no desire to
                explore the game further at this time -- due to the story being
                simple and short, I don't feel like I missed much of anything.
                I have great memories of progressing through the story, and 
                poor memories of end-game combat. I would definitely recommend
                playing the game once to any fans of the genre.
