                Selection of hobbies that I feel like writing about and sharing.
                I may add more in the future.

                <h3><a href="hobbies/cooking.html">cooking</a></h3>
                <p>
                I started cooking because I wanted to enjoy what I made if I
                had to feed myself, and this quickly escalated into a large 
                amount of learning and refinement. Cooking is now a hobby which
                I casually experiment with on at least a weekly basis.

                <p>
                I've been training Shōrin-ryū Karate and a line of Matayoshi
                Kobudo for years. In addition to regular classes I train at 
                home, take extensive notes, and have started building and 
                investing in some equipment. I'm unlikely to discuss my direct
                training here, but I may discuss things I build, strength and
                conditioning training, philosophy, and other such things.

                <h3><a href="hobbies/arcade.html">arcade</a></h3>
                <p>
                Arcade is a relatively new hobby for me (2020). I've been 
                particularly absorbed with shmups and the design of arcade
                sticks in general. While I also fiddle with beat-em-ups and
                platformers, I've revived a love for shmups that started long,
                long ago. I don't have nearly as much time as I'd like for 
                gaming, but I do keep at it and I'm also working on designing
                my own equipment.

                <p>
                I love old jrpgs and am slowly working through a list. One of 
                my favorite games (and greatest time investments) is Final 
                Fantasy 9, but this list mostly deviates heavily from that. I'm
                exploring the genre with some friends and will share the 
                experience here.

                <h3><a href="hobbies/bread.html">bread</a></h3>
                <p>
                In 2019 a friend of mine gave me a jar of sourdough starter and
                some basic references, and I joined them in a quest to make
                bread. I now bake bread weekly, experiment frequently, share
                notes, and have greatly expanded my bread repertoire.
