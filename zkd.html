                *This project currently lives within a single repository, but
                may encompass several in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                zkd aims to re-envision how information is shared and move away
                from the "web page" model. It is a slow-moving, experimental
                project that will provide ways to serve, download, and render
                data. The data model is inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> note taking methodology.
                </p>

                <p>
                For detailed design information, please refer to the 
                <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~eidolon/zkd">primary git repository on sr.ht</a> 
                which contains the current design documentation. This page will
                describe some notable aspects of zkd, and will be expanded to
                include more detail (and possibly screenshots) as zkd takes
                shape over time.
                </p>

                <h3>No Interactive Content</h3>
                <p>
                Scripting (e.g. JavaScript) is flat-out not supported. No 
                content is interactive beyond the ability to download assets 
                and follow links.
                </p>

                <h3>First-Class Mirroring Support</h3>
                <p>
                Information is often not large, and easy to cache. zkd 
                currently has a goal to support complete domain mirroring and 
                local browsing, with the ability to refresh from source. Many
                types of content are (relatively) permanent and will not need
                to be refresh. Content can be evicted trivially.
                </p>

                <h3>Inversion of Styling Control</h3>
                <p>
                The content author has little to no control over styling beyond
                what Markdown offers. Users viewing the content have complete
                control how they want to render their content, and will often
                have a uniform configuration for all content (but with the 
                ability to configure on a per-domain or dynamic basis). This 
                control extends to assets -- users may not want to eagerly 
                download and render things like images.
                </p>
                <p>
                zkd may provide the ability for content authors to provide 
                style hints, but users will always be able to ignore such 
                hints.
