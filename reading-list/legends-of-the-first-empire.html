                <p><em>Legends of the First Empire</em> is an epic fantasy series which chronicles the "beginning of the modern era" of the world Elan - a great turning point which dictates whether sentient life will flourish or gradually wear itself down to extinction. This series serves as a historic precursor to <em>The Riyria Chronicles</em>.</p>
                <p>This review covers the story as a whole, each book at a high level, and coverage of several themes that I think are worth discussing <em>across</em> books.</p>
                <h3>Summary Review</h3>
                <p><em>Note: This will be updated as I complete additional books in the series.</em></p>
                <p><em>Legends of the First Empire</em> reads very quickly and maintains what I consider to be a fast pace. There is downtime and there are sub-plots, but I do not feel that they substantially divert attention from the main storyline. This story feels planned, cohesive, and focused... across <em>all</em> of the books. This series-level planning makes it extremely smooth to transition from one book to another and I enjoy the overall effect.</p>
                <p>This series very deliberately approaches a classic fantasy setting from a different angle, and this is a large part of why I stuck with the series after the first book. You're introduced to Rhunes, Fhrey and Dherg - it's not until far later that you learn these to be Man, Elf and Dwarf; you also learn the etymology of those words. <em>Legends of the First Empire</em> is an origin story in a number of ways and this theme is utilized to excellent effect. Rather than the bow and arrow being an established tool, you get to read about the development of the <em>first</em> bow and arrow. The theme of origin and invention is discussed further in the relevant section of this review.</p>
                <p><em>Legends of the first empire</em> manages several characters at once and manages some level of growth of the important characters. One of my minor criticisms of the series is that I feel like so much of the cast and story relies on natural talent and innate character traits - I feel like character "growth" is at times too fast or doesn't feel completely earned. That being said this feels like a natural consequence of the pacing and scope of the story. Interestingly I'm <em>not</em> bothered at the rate of innovation by Roan in particular. One area where this story succeeds is character diversity - the way they're written they feel sufficiently different from one another and those differences are natural. While there _is_ some character-bucketing (e.g. unlikely hero, that sort of thing) they play out nicely. You also develop emotional attachment to characters and feel for them. I think the interpersonal aspect of characters is developed well and is thankfully more than single-dimensional for key characters.</p>
                <p>From the world building perspective I would say that the series paints a very <em>clear</em> picture of the known world, though this world feels relatively small. This is actually rather story-appropriate as the civilizations are explicitly small - Fhrey reproduce extremely slowly, Rhunes are geographically limited and are subjected to population control, and the Dherg were obliterated in war and severly limited in their ability to expand aftewards. I would say that in addition to this the world is also relatively small in terms of "depth" - you learn a lot about Elan by reading this series, but it feels somewhat high-level. One of the tradeoffs in this series is that it focuses far more on a specific chain of events and important actions of key characters, and doesn't invest so much in extensive exposition of world details. I don't view this as a con, merely a different style - it makes this series easy to read and helps it retain focus.</p>
                <h3>Age of Myth<a name="age-of-myth"></a></h3>
                <p>The first book introduces the major players of the world from both the Rhune and Fhrey perspective. Rhunes generally regard the Fhrey as immortal gods - Fhrey live for thousands of years, while humans live for less than one hundred. The primary focus of this book is the small human village of Dahl Rhen, which is suddenly (forcefully) forced to confront the world and reconsider many long-held beliefs. By the end of the story we see superstition and isolation begin to melt away as some of the humans learn that sometimes a bear is just a bear, demons might just be bad humans, Fhrey are not gods, and they have agency in the world beyond their village.</p>
                <p>I think this story did a great job of managing a self-contained plot while still providing a very natural tie-in to the larger story that encompasses the series. It did so in a way that provided an excellent cut-off point - Rhunes are given the choice to mature and change, or die. At the same time we see the sparks of innovation from within the Rhunic community (e.g. Roan's problem solving and inventions), and wisdom gradually gaining priority over raw strength.</p>
                <p>The end of <em>Age of Myth</em> was very satisfying, and accomplished that by being completely mundane. There were no demons - merely some evil, traitorous Rhunes. The forest is just a forest, and the bear is just a bear that was trained to eat human flesh. Abandoned babies aren't taken by spirits, but they might be raised by a compassionate passerby. Fhrey can be killed via decapitation, just like any other mortal creature. Similarly a swift knock to the back of their head will fell them just like any Rhune. At the same time the Fhrey begin to see that their power is not absolute, and that the Rhunes might be more than animals. By the time the story ends, the reader is well-primed for the shift in tone and perspective.</p>
