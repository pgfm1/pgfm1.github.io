                <h2>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (25th Anniversay Edition)</h2>
                <div class="article-meta">Review Date: March 24, 2020 -- author=Steven Levy; format=novel; publication=1984 (2010); genres=non-fiction</div>
                <h3>The Hacker Ethic</h3>
                <p>
                It only feels appropriate to document the <em>Hacker Ethic</em> here, prior to my review:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Access to computers &#8212; and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works &#8212; should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!</li>
                    <li>All information should be free.</li>
                    <li>Mistrust Authority &#8212; Promote Decentralization</li>
                    <li>Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race or position.</li>
                    <li>You can create art and beauty on a computer.</li>
                    <li>Computers can change your life for the better.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reaction & Summary</h3>
                <p>
                While I read technical articles almost constantly, this is the first major work of non-fiction I have consumed in a very long time. For pleasure reading I trend towards science fiction &amp; fantasy, making this a departure from the norm for me. At first I needed to force myself to continue reading, but after finishing a single major session I was sucked in.

                Hackers was fascinating to me (insert: "I'm something of a Hacker myself.") in a few ways. The first was simply the historical context and insight into the lives of early hackers: their personalities, mannerisms, and how they approached technology. I found them extremely relatable in several regards, and some of the descriptions regarding attitude (hacking for the sake of hacking, getting sucked into your work) eerily accurate. Aside from that, it's just flat out interesting to read about the cultures that sprouted into existence around computers. I also enjoyed the breadth of people and topics explored by this book, as opposed to just selecting "the highlights".
                </p>

                Descriptions of the computers and <em>the amount of effort required to interact with them</em> were also extremely interesting... though also sufficient - I have no desire to invest large amounts of time into learning and operating old comptuers. Still, there's something humbling about my forerunners flipping toggles thousands of times or punching stacks of cards only to have the entire result crumble due to a single mistake. It's finally just fun to read about words, people and companies that I'm familiar with and can recognize, and then learn about their origins and how they grew (and/or vanished). The coverage of Sierra Online took me completely by surprise and I loved reading about early gaming and how computer gaming became an industry.

                Hackers contains three major sections which study the origins of hacking culture through the early 1980's. It picks major focal points to return to throughout each section, and also contains omnipresent tie-back to the Hacker Ethic, a term coined by this book. At times the romanticization (and perhaps religious presentation of) the Hacker Ethic is a bit excessive, though I don't think that particularly takes away from the book and it provides a consistent point of relation. Within these sections - which linearly follow time - Levy describes a number of people, groups, minor projects, major projects, technological milestones, companies, organizations and more. I'll reiterate that I enjoyed the breadth of perspective this book provided.

                <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                <p>
                I think that Hackers is worth a read, especially if you have any particular interest in "Computers". It's a very engaging presentation of a slice of history. I want to describe the tone as "conversational", not dry and relatively easy to read.
                </p>
                <p>
                I need a break before I attempt more non-fiction, but Hackers was sufficiently enjoyable that I'm not opposed to trying more this year.
                </p>
                <h3>Criticisms</h3>
                <p>
                I have a few minor criticisms of this book.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some descriptions feel a bit inappropriate, overdone, or something along those lines. One that stuck out to me was of a hacker who stole someone elses tools, and didn't particularly care for those tools. The way the situation was presented, it read almost like the unfortunate victim was outright <em>wrong</em> to dare to care about any piece of personal property. Essentially that being a hacker justified being a disrespectful asshole to someone and hurting them for your own sake. This might be an extreme interpretation, but I would have loved to see that situation described different, or perhaps criticized.
                </p>
                <p>
                The sentiment that (roughly) societal/cultural bias couldn't account for the complete lack of women getting "sucked in" felt off to me -- almost like it was added just to ensure that was addressed so the book could move on, but in a way that adhered to the book's casual tone. It certainly didn't ruin the book for me, it just felt odd.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some parts of Hackers seemed to run on a bit too long, but I can't put my finger on it. I don't have any particular piece in mind, that was just a sentiment in the back of my head while I was reading. My brain wanted to skip forward.
