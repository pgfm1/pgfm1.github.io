                <h3>Dawn of Wonder<a name="dawn-of-wonder"></a></h3>
                <p>The first book in <em>The Wakening</em> is an extremely detailed exercise in world building and developing the main character. Hailing from the Mistyvales in northern Thirna, Aedan is a young (almost thirteen) boy known for his incredible strategic mind and sense of adventure. After Lekran slavers kidnap and sacrificially murder his best friend Kalry, his familiy is forced from their home. They travel south through the legendary DinEilan and arrive in Castath, the city where most of this story is focused. Here Aedan joins the Marshals to fulfill his life goal of bringing justice to Lekrau and eradicating the slave trade. After passing the entrance exam, Aedan is enrolled at the academy to learn the skills necessary to serve as an ambassador, spy, scout or otherwise in foreign nations. He finds a group of friends, breaks rules, commits himself to learning, and eventually becomes involved in matters greater than the academy due to his experience in DinEilan. He is thrown into a life-and-death struggle against both the soldiers of the prince and the unknown terror of Kult√ªhm, an abandoned fortress of a long-dead civilization.</p>
                <p><em>Dawn of Wonder</em> is packed with content, so there's a lot to comment upon. One thing I want to mention right away is the author's attention to detail and research. At one point in the story, a bowyer named Torval demonstrates how a bow and arrow for survival may be created in a single day. The author has a video of them demonstrating this process and firing the completed bow! I love seeing this type of work folded into a story, and it speaks to the general level of detail in the story. Concepts and processes are generally explained rather than glossed over. When a secret passage is discovered, the analysis and the method are both presented along with the detail required to visualize how it occurred. At a slightly more coarse-grained level, the story delivers information about countries, languages, and cultures. The different classes and factions within the city are explored on some level, as are international relations.</p>
                <p>One thing that blows my mind about this story is that it has a classic "school" setting... except for that the main character actually pays attention, the education receives attention, and the coursework is overall conveyed to have immense value. I've read other stories where the school trope is essentially leveraged as a setting, but it's mostly about the main character doing other things and often treating their school with outright hostility. While Aedan <em>is</em> prone to breaking rules, I feel like the school setting truly adds value here and doesn't position the main character as artificially ahead or behind in most cases. I appreciate this about the story.</p>
                <p>Overall I think that the world is well-crafted and interesting enough for me to read more to see it opened and expanded. The characters are interesting and provide some variety, though there doesn't seem to be deep development outside of the main character. This makes some sense as the timeframe of the story is relatively short (couple of years), but the highlight really is Aedan. That's not to say that characters don't change or open up at all - I'm actually pretty happy with how they're managed and how they realistically do make adjustments to the world while retaining their underlying personality. If I think about characters that truly annoy me from a writing perspective I come up empty off the top of my head.</p>
                <p>The ending of this story is novel to me. While many fantasy epics bridge into greater-and-greater scale, <em>Dawn of Wonder</em> actually takes a step back. While Aedan is made aware of potentially global dangers (the storms, the imminent war with the Fenn) he sets them aside to focus on rescuing Kalry. Before this his goal was vague and lofty - bring justice to Lekrau. It evolves to a more-focused goal that appears to have a very clear porgression. This means that rather than immediate escalating to a world-encompassing scale, the next book (I would guess) will remain constrained and continue to build up the larger problems in the background over time. I appreciate this pacing and find it refreshing.</p>
                <h4>Abuse</h4>
                <p>One difficult topic covered by this story is abuse and the deep impact that it can have on the abused party. Aedan is routinely abused by his father, Clauman, and sees himself as "damaged" by the experience. An underlying sub-story is how Aedan deals with this part of his life and eventually tries (and thankfully succeeds) to confront and overcome it to some degree, at least enough to regain control and agency. Not having personally experienced this there is only so much I can do to comment on this part of the story, but it <em>feels</em> well-written overall. Aedan's experiences made me feel sympathetic, angry, and deeply uncomfortable at different points. I didn't feel like Aedan's abuse was handled dismissively. I was rooting for the main character to gain a semblance of "freedom", as it was described in the story.</p>
                <p>There are two parts that I did <em>not</em> appreciate. One was the momentus scene with the Ancient One. While this was probably supposed to be conveyed as a deeply moving religious moment, I was pretty disappointed by it. I felt that it cheapened Aedan's struggles to a point - he had been making progress, was able to discuss his father with others, and had people he trusted tell him that they didn't think less of him for it. In a critical moment he was able to push himself further than ever before... and then he's struck by lightning and has a religious moment that miraculously allows him to move on and forgive his father and realise that resentment towards his father was poisoning him. The whole situation felt like an unfortunate plot device and really disrupted the main story and the sub-story with Aedan's father for me.</p>
                <p>The second related part was the "forgiveness" aspect and how that played out with respect to <em>other</em> characters. Near the end of the story Aedan tells others about being disowned after his final confrontation with Clauman, and the general sentiment is that they hope his father changes his mind. The father who beat Aedan. The father who they know is a criminal who actively hurts others almost constantly. While refusing to accept that his father needs to be apprehended feels excusable for Aedan, it hurts to see others reinforcing this. It feels like not only like they are accepting a world in which Aedan suffers his father's abuse again, but also ignoring the larger scale of damage going on behind the scenes. The book goes out of its way to magically plot-avoid his father away from confrontation with <em>anyone</em> else, which feels rather artificial and is possibly setup to further hurt Aedan while the people that care about him remain sidelined. Perhaps the characters are just attempting to be supportive and we just lack their point of view. Perhaps I'm lacking a critical bit of empathy relevant to this plot point.</p>
                <h4>Responsibility and Maturity</h4>
                <p>The theme of maturity was quite jarring in certain cases. Essentially Aedan is treated like an adult, but is not expected to have the responsibility of an adult. At times this gap does not make sense, and I was disappointed to not see Aedan grow more during the story in this regard. By the end of the story I do not expect Aedan to be capable of his mission to save Kalry - I expect him to continue acting like a child and make mistakes regardless of how attentive he is to his training. There are some clear indications of his age that make great sense. His infatuation with Iiona, for instance, and coping with the notion of a relationship for the first time. Here he quickly gets reprimanded by others and grows from the experience.</p>
                <p>On the flip side, Aedan breaks into places he is not allowed to be and is never punished - only encouraged. He puts his friends at risk and damages property. The attentive student refuses to study anything relevant to Lekrau despite that knoweldge being able to <em>directly enable him to fight Lekrau more effectively</em>. He harbours an irrational hatred and outright refuses to listen to anyone who tells him he might be mistaken... yet is supported and trusted with state secrets. The <em>Ancient One</em> shows him a book and he refuses to read it out of pure hatred... after learning how poisonous hatred can be <em>from the Ancient One</em> and having the resulting epiphany change his life. To nobody's surprise the book turns out to be absolutely critical and he was content to let Kalry die because he couldn't handle a few words on a page. The general theme is that Aedan is a capable and respectful youth, so long as it does not interfere with his selfish desires. This is less of a problem for the general setting, and a far greater problem given what Aedan knows, his goal of infiltrating Lekrau, and how many people could die if he missteps. I'm extremely hopeful that the second book (possibly via timeskip) shows a matured Aedan who begins to consider his mission with deadly seriousness, not just earnest fervor.</p>
