                <h2>FF7 Revisited</h2>
                <div class="article-meta">March 22, 2020 - [gaming]</div>
                <p>
                    Due to the upcoming release of Final Fantasy 7 Remastered, I decided to play through the original once again. The last time I played FF7 was years ago, using the ePSXe emulator as I haven't owned a Playstation for some time. For this playthrough I'm using the Steam-released version of the game. I am treating this as a casual playthrough with no requirements for speed, completion, or other challenges.
                </p>
                <h4>Gut Reactions</h4>
                <p>
                    This game has aged well, in my opinion. Yes, the graphics are extremely dated, but the core game is still entertaining and enjoyable to me. It's also possible that I've just played so much Final Fantasy that I don't notice the flaws as much. I'm enjoying the story despite knowing the main points of the story, and there are tons of little details that pop out after not having played for so long. The gameplay is <em>not</em> too slow for me and I still find battles enjoyable. I even went on a small grinding spree. Also I'm still in love with the music.
                </p>
                <h4>The Date</h4>
                <p>
                    It's a toss up between Tifa and Barret, but I have a feeling that Tifa has more points. I never really committed to either; I just made a point to avoid Aeris.
                </p>
                <h4>Wall Market</h4>
                <p>
                    Cloud went all the way and got pretty for Don Coreno. It felt good to bring new inspiration to the dress maker. Remember, you need to squat to get pretty.
                </p>
                <h4>Regarding Yuffie</h4>
                <p>
                    I've found myself unreasonably angry with Yuffie, even before she stole my materia. As such, she has not received any play time thus far. I'm determined to forgive her after completing the Wutai sidequest, which I just started.
                </p>
                <h4>Fort Condor</h4>
                <p>
                    After fighting the first battle for Fort Condor, I went about my business and haven't yet returned. For some reason I've never been able to get into that mini game. RIP Condor.
                </p>
                <h4>Thoughts on the Steam Port</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm extremely impressed with the Steam port. The minor enhancements to the 3d models are very welcome, as is the fullscreen support at high resolutions. Controller support is working well, everything loads quickly, and I can't think of any immediate complaints.
