                This website will always be a work in progress and subject to
                sudden changes.

                Dead-simple database migration tool/library for Scala. Possibly
                scoped to PostgreSQL support only. Geese migrate where I'm 
                from.

                Manual copypasta stash with buckets. I find myself with topical
                things that I want to record in groups, and often destroy the
                entire group at some point. Yes, I know there are note taking
                apps where I could do essentially this. Yes, I know this is not
                particularly ground-breaking. I want a little more than a 
                clipboard manager, and less than a note taking app. I also want
                something to do, hence <em>pasta</em>!

                <h3>meager run mode (mrm) [design]</h3>
                <span class="descriptor">vcs:<a href="#">n/a</a> -- [library, scala]</span>
                <p>
                Uniform handling of different run modes for Cats Effect. Here a
                run mode is defined as something (usually at the top) that defines
                how to choose, run, and evaluate some effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                Let's say you draft a refactor of an existing feature: you might
                want to run the new code in the background at the same time as the
                old code, and then compare the results after both finish. After you
                are confident in the feature, you may temporarily flip this 
                relationship to enable the new feature fully but still compare
                results.
                </p>
                <p>
                Another case could be percentage-based distribution of requests,
                but only one-or-the-other piece of code is chosen. Similarly, you
                could simply alternate between two implementations. You could also
                run both and select the result which becomes available first.
                </p>
                <p>
                The <em>mrm</em> library also provides diagnostic output which can
                be used (or ignored) for logging and statistics tracking for the
                impacted code paths.

                Repository with some scripts that are useful to me, and 
                probably not useful to you. Updated very randomly.
