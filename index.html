                <h3>January 20, 2021</h3>
                <p>
                I haven't had much time for personal projects, but I did manage
                to add the hobbies section that I mentioned before. Check it
                out at <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies</a>. Yes, I know that the
                lists don't actually link to any content. I'm just drafting the
                beginning and will fill things out as I'm able.
                </p>
                <h3>January 17, 2021</h3>
                <p>
                It turns out that being a new parent is hard, and I haven't 
                touched my computer in a long while. I'm starting work again
                soon, which means I'll also be back on track for working on
                projects during the week after my child goes to bed! Progress
                will likely be slow at first as I get back into things, but I'm
                excited to push some updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                On a side note, I'm likely going to add sections to this 
                website, possibly categorized under a blob section called 
                "hobbies" or something similar. These would be casual posts on
                random things that I work on or do.
                </p>
                <h3>December 20, 2020</h3>
                <p>
                Started working aggressively on 
                <span class="mono">meager-test</span>, the test framework that
                I'm creating. Added it to this website as well. Although I've
                been accumulating projects, I generally prefer building a
                foundation so I'm fine creating a bit of ordering between my
                projects. I'll likely move this to MVP while picking away at
                <span class="mono">goose</span>, and go from there.
                </p>
                <h3>December 13, 2020</h3>
                <p>
                Wrote down my thoughts on <span class="mono">mrm</span> before 
                I forget them, though at this point I'm a little over-saturated 
                on projects. I'm hoping to get some good time on paternity leave 
                to make some better progress and push completed versions of at 
                least one library.
                </p>
                <p>
                As part of working on 
                <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~eidolon/goose">goose</a> I began to 
                use versioned packaging, which has lead to two additional outputs. 
                The first of those is a 
                <a href="logs/2020-12-13-versioned-packaging-and-project-organization.html">log</a> 
                which describes the why and
                how of that decision. The second is a
                <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~eidolon/scripts/tree/master/scripts/replace-all">script</a> 
                called <em>replace-all</em> which I created
                and used to perform mass package/import migrations.

                <p>
                Some goose progress made this week, and also came up with 
                another project idea - pasta! I found myself wanting to 
                randomly have semi-organized copy/paste with easy yanking and
                purging, but I've never really gotten into using note taking
                apps to do that. Seems like it'll be quick and fun.
                </p>
                <h3>December 05, 2020</h3>
                <p>
                Added a <a href="logs.html">logs</a> section today where I can
                publish short articles, likely related to software development.
                </p>
                <h3>December 02, 2020</h3>
                <p>
                I completely redesigned the website and started providing some
                focus on some things that I'm working on. I'm particularly
                excited about the prospect of <a href="zkd.html">zkd</a> and
                want to encourage myself to work on it more. I'm also trying to
                make myself make <em>more</em>, <em>smaller</em> contributions
                to projects that I've pushed publicly. Finally, I'm attempting
                to create some new small projects to get me producing things
                that can be completed in a short time frame.
